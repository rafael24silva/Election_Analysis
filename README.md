## Election Audit Summary
This script can be useful for any upcoming elections. We can modify this script to include a larger number of counties, or a larger election that includes more candidates. We can filter the script even more to isolate certain categories like, for example, how many people from Arapahoe County voted for Diana. We can add more data and go even further by filtering by the number of people that voted who are under 30 or sort by gender. This code is very versatile and can be rescripted for any kind of data analysis that is needed.
